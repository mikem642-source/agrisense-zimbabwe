  <!-- SECTION: ABOUT AGRISENSE (Problem, Mission, Context) -->
  <section id="about">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>About AgriSense Zimbabwe</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture in Zimbabwe is constrained not only by climate variability and resource limitations,
        but by persistent information gaps and coordination failures across the value chain.
        Decisions on planting, input use, and risk management are often made with limited, delayed,
        or fragmented data.
      </p>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe addresses this challenge by treating agricultural intelligence as
        shared public infrastructure. Rather than automating farming decisions, the platform
        provides timely, explainable decision support that strengthens human judgement at farm,
        institutional, and policy levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initiative is grounded in Zimbabwe’s smallholder‑dominated agricultural context and
        designed with regional scalability in mind, aligning with broader African food security
        and climate adaptation priorities.
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>How the Platform Works</h2>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe operates as a decision-support system that transforms dispersed
        environmental and agricultural data into practical, timely intelligence. The platform
        is designed for simplicity, low bandwidth conditions, and interpretability at every stage.
      </p>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Environmental & Satellite Inputs</h3>
          <p>
            Satellite imagery, rainfall estimates, and climate forecasts are used to observe
            crop conditions, weather patterns, and environmental stress factors across
            agricultural regions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Analytical Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Analytical models identify patterns and risks related to planting windows,
            moisture availability, and crop development. Outputs are designed to be
            explainable rather than opaque predictions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Farmer-Level Advisories</h3>
          <p>
            Context-appropriate advisories are delivered through basic communication
            channels such as SMS and WhatsApp, ensuring accessibility without requiring
            smartphones or internet access.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Aggregated Institutional Insights</h3>
          <p>
            At a higher level, anonymised and aggregated insights support early warning,
            planning, and coordination for institutions, researchers, and policymakers.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, AgriSense Zimbabwe prioritises transparency, data minimisation,
        and alignment with existing agricultural knowledge systems.

      <h2>Governance & Ethical Framework</h2>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe is established as a public-interest digital infrastructure initiative.
        Its governance framework is designed to ensure trust, accountability, and responsible
        stewardship of agricultural data and artificial intelligence systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform recognises farmers as the primary custodians of their data. Participation
        is voluntary and based on informed, opt-in consent. Data generated through the platform
        is used strictly for decision support and learning purposes, not for commercial
        exploitation or individual profiling.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Farmers retain ownership and control of their data at all times</li>
        <li>Participation is voluntary, transparent, and opt-in</li>
        <li>Only aggregated, non-identifiable insights are shared beyond the farm level</li>
        <li>AI models are designed to be explainable, auditable, and context-aware</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe is intended to complement and strengthen existing agricultural
        extension systems, research institutions, and policy processes. It does not replace
        human decision-making, but supports it with timely, interpretable evidence.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION: PILOT FOCUS (Evidence-first deployment) -->
  <section id="pilots">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Pilot Focus</h2>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe’s pilot phase is designed to operate within clearly defined scope and constraints.
      </p>
      <p>The pilot will focus on a limited number of nationally significant crops and selected districts representing contrasting agro-ecological conditions. This approach is intended to test both advisory effectiveness and early risk signalling under varying climatic patterns.
      </p>
      <p>The pilot is not intended to optimise outcomes in all conditions. Rather, it is designed to validate the platform’s ability to support informed decision-making, particularly under uncertainty, and to operate responsibly when conditions are unfavourable.</p>
      <p>The pilot phase prioritises learning, restraint, and alignment with existing agricultural extension systems, forming the foundation for evidence-based expansion over time.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- SECTION: LEADERSHIP (Accountability & Stewardship) -->
  <section id="leadership">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Founder & Leadership</h2>
      <p><strong>Ngoni Mupfurutsa</strong><br />Founder & Lead Architect</p>
      <p>
        AgriSense Zimbabwe was founded with a systems‑thinking approach to public‑interest
        technology, combining perspectives from agriculture, data systems, ethics, and
        long‑term institutional design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The leadership philosophy emphasises stewardship, resilience, and alignment with
        national and regional development goals.

  <!-- SECTION: STATUS & PARTNERSHIPS (Engagement posture) -->
  <section id="status">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Status & Partnerships</h2>
      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>AgriSense Zimbabwe is in an early institutional development phase.</p>
      <p>
        The initiative is focused on establishing a sound governance framework, validating system architecture, and preparing for pilot implementation in selected districts representing contrasting agro-ecological conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This phase prioritises clarity of role, ethical restraint, and alignment with existing agricultural and policy systems.
      </p>
      <h3>Pilot Preparation</h3>
      <p>Pilot preparation is centred on a limited number of nationally significant crops and is designed to test both advisory effectiveness and early risk signalling under variable climatic conditions.</p>
      <p>The pilot approach emphasises learning and loss-avoidance, particularly in marginal conditions, and is designed to complement — not replace — agricultural extension services.</p>
      <h3>Partnership Approach</h3>
      <p>AgriSense approaches partnerships cautiously and deliberately.</p>
      <p>Collaboration is explored with public institutions, development partners, and research organisations whose mandates align with food security, climate resilience, and responsible use of data and technology.</p>
      <p>The initiative prioritises institutional trust, clarity of scope, and long-term system integrity over rapid expansion.</p>
